## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身

**Lisa**: Hey, guys. Welcome back to OpenLanguage. You'r listening to an A2 lesson, and my name is Lisa.

**Johnny**: Hey, guys. My name is Johnny.

**Lisa**: Now, a lot of our listeners are parents. A lot of you are moms and dads. And, a lot of you guys have kids.

**Johnny**: Right, or maybe you don't have kids, but you just love babies like I do. Well, today's lesson is a good lesson for you.

**Lisa**: Yeah, because in our dialogue today, we have two moms, Jen and Anne. And they are talking about Jen's new baby boy. So today, we'll learn to talk all about babies and we'll learn things we can say to a new mom.

**Johnny**: Right. Things like, "Aww, your baby is so cute." Actually, that's the little of our lesson today. All right, let's go listen to Anne and Jen talk.

**Lisa**: All right, sounds good.



### 核心对话

**A**: Aww! Your baby is so cute! What's his name? How old is he? `啊！你的宝宝太可爱了！他叫什么名字呀？多大了？`

**B**: Thanks. His name is Peter. He's only six months old. `谢谢。他叫 Peter。刚六个月大。`

**A**: Hi Peter! I love your tiny shoes. And look at your chubby legs! `嗨，Peter! 我喜欢你的小鞋子。看你胖乎乎的小腿哟！`

**B**: Yeah, he's a hungry baby! I fed him eight times yesterday! `是啊，他是个贪吃的宝宝！我昨天喂了他八次呢！`

**A**: Oh, does he sleep a lot? `噢，他睡得多吗？`

**B**: Yeah. But he was crying all night last night. So I didn't sleep a lot. `多哦。但昨晚他一直在哭，所以我都没怎么睡。`

**A**: I have a one-year-old daughter. I understand how you feel. `我有个一岁大的女儿。我知道你的感受。`

**B**: Maybe we should hang out sometime! `那我们应该找个时间聚聚呀！`



## 03.对话精讲

> cute `adj.可爱的`

**Lisa**: Okay, and we're back. So we just heard Anne and Jen. And they're talking about Jen's baby boy, Peter. Now Anne she starts this, and she says, "Aww! Your baby is so cute! What's his name? How old is he?"

**Johnny**: Um, ok. So this word "cute," we can use it to talk about a lot of different things. But today, Anne is using it talk about Jen's baby.

**Lisa**: Yes, so kids are cute. They have a round face, they have big eyes. "Cute" is an adjective and we use it for people and things that make us say, "Aww...."

**Johnny**: "Aww..." Yeah, exactly, we often use it for little things, like babies, puppies`n.小狗`, kittens`n.小猫`.  Things that are small and we really like them.

**Lisa**: Yeah, but if we think a girl or a boy is good-looking, we can also say "cute". For example, your girlfriend is very cute.

**Johnny**: Right, ow we could also say, "Your girlfriend looks cute."

**Lisa**: That's right. But when you meet a baby, we often say this, "Aww! The baby is so cute!" Next, we usually ask what's his name, how old is he.

**Johnny**: Yeah, and the baby's name is Peter. He's six months old, so he's a very little baby.

> tiny `adj.很小的`

**Lisa**: Yeah, he's tiny, and that is what Anne says next. She says, "Hi Peter! I love your tiny shoes. And look at your chubbly legs!"

**Johnny**: Okay, so yeah. "Tiny," that just means really samll. And it's a good word to use when we're talking about babies because babies often wear tiny clothes.

**Lisa**: Yeah, because babies have tiny hands, tiny feet, tiny everything, so they wear really really tiny shoes.

> chubby `adj.胖乎乎的`

**Johnny**: Exactly. Okay, but babies also can be chubby sometimes.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so it sounds like Peter has chubby legs, so "chubby" means this person or baby is a little round. They're a little bit fat, but it's cute.

**Johnny**: Yeah, but we don't like to call babies fat. It kind of sounds not nice. So we often use this word "chubby" because, like Lisa said, it means fat and cute.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so babies can have "chbby" cheeks. They can have "chubby" arms or they can have "chubby" legs.

**Johnny**: Exactly. I love "chubby" babies, the're so cute. But you know when we're talking about bigger people like adults, can we use this word "chubby"?

**Lisa**: We can, we can. But it can be mean, so it's best to just use "chubby" for yourselt. For example, I can say, "After Christmas, I always feel chubby, because I eat lots of cake and turky`n.火鸡`, and you know a lot of good food."

> fed `v.喂养`

**Johnny**: Same, same. Okay well, it sounds like the baby is "chubby" because he eats a lot. Jen says, "He's a hungry baby! I fed him eight times yesterday!"

**Lisa**: Yeah, yeah. Okay. "I feed him eight times yesterday." So this means that she gave him food, she gave him milk.

**Johnny**: Exactly, babies can't cook food, babies can't use a spoon, so the parents have to feed the baby.

**Lisa**: Yes, so feed, "F-E-E-D" is the present tense. Parents "feed" kids. You can "feed" your pets. But for the past tense, we use "fed." "I fed him eight times yesterday."

**Johnny**: Yes, so this verb is in the past tense and talking about the past tense is our grammar point today. So we'll talk more about that at the end of the lesson.

**Lisa**: Sure, sure. Okay, but earlier I said that we can feed pets, right? Did you ever have a pet, Johnny?

**Johnny**: Uh. I had a pet fish when I was little, but I forgot to "feed" him, so he died.

**Lisa**: Oh. no. But I think that's a common problem. Okay, but babies eat a lot and they sleep a lot. So Anne asks Jen next, "Oh, does he sleep a lot?"

> crying `v.哭泣`

**Johnny**: And Jen says, "Yeah. But he was crying all night last night. So I didn't sleep a lot."

**Lisa**: Um. Okay, so babies cry a lot.

**Johnny**: Exactly, babies cry then they can't sleep; babies cry when they're hungry; babies just like to cry.

**Lisa**: Yeah, that's right! That's right! But adults cry too.

**Johnny**: Yeah, I remember when my pet fish, Jimmy, when he died, I cried.

**Lisa**: Aww, yeah, we often cry when our pets diet too. Okay, but babies they cry all the time. And she says he was crying last night, so she didn't get a lot of sleep.

> understand `v.理解`

**Johnny**: Oh no, that's too bad for Jen. Yeah.... But you know what, Anne says, "I have a one-year-old daughter. I understand how you feel."

**Lisa**: Um, okay, so she understands, she knows how Jen feels because she has a one-year-old daughter.

**Johnny**: Right. So it sounds like Anne has had the same problems before. Maybe Anne didn't sleep a lot when her daughter was a little baby.

**Lisa**: Yeah, exactly. So when we have the same experience, we know how they feel. We can just say, "I understand!" Now for me, I don't have kids. But my brother does, so I am an aunt. I am an anut of two noisy boys.

**Lisa**: So I can understand. Okay, it's just a good thing to say to a mom when she's talking about the hard times that she's having with the kid.

> hang out `phr.（与某人）闲逛，一起玩`

**Johnny**: That's right. You know what? I think Jen wants to be Anne's friend because she says, "Maybe we should hang out sometime!"

**Lisa**: Yeah, so she is inviting Anne to spend some time with her. "To hang out with someone" means to spend time with them and to have fun with them.

**Johnny**: Exactly! I feel like the kids will probably come too, so maybe they will hang out at the park or maybe they'll hang out at Anne's house or Jen's house.

**Lisa**: Yeah, that's true, that's true!  So it's really good word to use with your friends. For example, Johnny and I, we hang out after work.  We hang out at restaurants.

**Johnny**: Right. Or in the summer we like to hang out at the beach.

**Lisa**: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So just pay attention`n.注意力` to the prepositions`n.介词；系词`. We hang out "with" someone and we hang out "at" a place.

**Johnny**: Okay, that's the end of our dialogue. Now it's time to talk about our grammar.

**Lisa**: Okay, so our grammar point today is talking about the past tense. But we have two types here: the simple past "fed" and the past continuous "was crying." So, what is the difference?

**Johnny**: Well, we use both to talk about the past, but let's look at the verb "fed" first, that's a simple past verb. We use this to talk about something that happened in the past. Like Jen fed her baby in the past; she fed the bay yesterday.

**Lisa**: Yeah, she fed him eight times yesterday or I watched TV yesterday. And Johnny and I ate at a resaurant last week. That's the simple past. But why did she say, "He was crying last night?" Why did she use "be + verb-ing," "was crying."

**Johnny**: Well, she used the past continuous verb there because she's talking about something that happenend for a period`n.周期` of time. Maybe it was fifteen minutes. Maybe it was thirty minutes or an hour. We don't know. What we do know is that the baby was crying for some amount of time.

**Lisa**: Yes, so maybe he started crying at 1AM and finished crying at 3AM. It was a long time. So when we want to say that something is not a short time, that something continues fot a long time, we use "be + verb-ing," "was doing," "was eating," "was crying."

**Johnny**: Exactly. So if she said he cried, then we know that the baby cried in the past, but we don't know if the baby cried for a long time or a short time.

**Lisa**: Yes. Okay, but let's give them some more examples of the past continuous. For example, I was studying all night.

**Johnny**: Um. Sounds like Lisa, she's a good students. Here's another one. The kids were playing from 1PM to 3PM  in the park.

**Lisa**: Or I can ask Johnny, "What were you doing yesterday?"

**Johnny**: I was working, you know this, Lisa.

**Lisa**: Yes, I do, I do. Okay, what about you guys? What were you doing yesterday? Let us know in the comments and try to use "be + verb-ing."

**Johnny**: Okay, well, that's it for our lesson. So let's listen to Anne and Jen talk one more time.

**Lisa**: All right, let's do that.

### Grammar/语法

#### 进去进行时 vs. 一般过去时

对话中，宝宝的妈妈说了两个过去时态的句子，一句是在讲述孩子昨晚哭闹时说：“But he was crying all night last night.(但昨天他一整晚都在哭。)” 这句话使用的是过去进行时。另一句是在描述昨天喂孩子的次数时说：“I fed him eight times yesterday!(我昨天喂了他八次呢！)” 这句话使用的时态是一般过去时。



过去进行时和一般过去时描述的都是过去发生的事情，它们有什么区别呢？



1. 过去进行时：

   在对话中的第一个例子里，昨晚发生的事是“he was crying(他一直哭)”，时间是“all night last night(昨晚一整夜)”，说明昨晚宝宝哭泣的这个动作是长时间进行的，所以使用过去进行时态，强调在过去的某个时间段内某个动作持续进行。

   过去进行时还可表示在过去的某个时刻某个动作正在进行，比如：She was watching TV at 8 last night.(她昨晚八点正在看电视。)强调在昨晚八点这个时刻，她看电视的这个动作正在进行。

   过去进行时使用的结构为：

   主语 + was/were + 动词 ing。句中往往还要加入某个时刻或时间段的表达。

2. 一般过去时：

   在对话中的第二个例子里，昨天发生的事是“I fed him eight times(我喂了他八次)”，时间是“yesterday(昨天)”，喂孩子的这个动作在昨天是断断续续完成的，不是一直在进行的，因此使用了一般过去时态。再举个例子：“I cooked at home last weekend.(上周末我在家做饭了。)”上周末是个时间范围，期间并不是一直在做饭的，强调的是做饭这件事本身，不强调过程。

   一般过去时使用的结构为：

   主语 + 动词过去式。句中常加入的时间词为过去某个比较笼统的时间。

   总结一下，过去进行时和一般过去时都用于描述过去发生的事情，但过去进行时强调的是过去的某个时间段或时间点某个动作正在或持续进行，而一般过去时仅表明过去做了某件事，只强调结果不强调过程。

   

   1. I was studying all night! `我一整晚都在学习！`
   2. The kids were playing from 1 to 3 in the park. `孩子们 1 点到 3 点都在公园里玩。`
   3. I went to Anna's house twice last week. `上周我去了 Anna 家两次。`
