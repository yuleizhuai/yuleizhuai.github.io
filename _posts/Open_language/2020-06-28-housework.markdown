## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身 

**Johnny**: Hey guys, welcome back to OpenLanguage. This is Johnny.

**Adam**: And this is Adam.

**Johnny**: So Adam, what is our lesson called today?

**Adam**: It's called "Doing housework."

**Johnny**: Housework, that's like cleaning our kitchen, washing our clothes or taking out the garbage.

**Adam**: Yep, all of those things are housework`n.家务事`. Now, it's not homework`n.家庭作业，课外作业`. That's what your teachers make you do.

**Johnny**: Okay, so today we have a dialogue between Kate and Mike and they are talking about doing housework in their apartment. Now, let's listen to our dialogue.



### 核心对话

**A**: Mike, we should do some housework. Our place is really messy. `Mike, 我们该做家务了。我们的房子太乱了。`

**B**: You're right. I can do the dishes and clean the floor. `你说的对。我可以洗碗、拖地。`

**A**: Okay. I'll tidy up the living room and bedroom. `好。那我打扫客厅和卧室。`

**B**: Have you done the laundry? `你洗衣服了吗？`

**A**: No, I haven't. I thought it was your turn. `还没洗。我以为轮到你了。`

**B**: No, I did it last week. `不是我，我上周洗过了。`

**A**: Oh, you're right. I'll do it after I clean. `哦，你说的对。那我打扫完就去洗。`

**B**: Cool. I'll take out the garbage. `好的。我去扔垃圾。`



## 03.对话精讲

> housework `n.家务活`

**Johnny**:  Okay, so we just listen to our dialogue between Kate and Mike. And it starts with Kate saying, "Mike, we should do some housework. Our place is really messy."

**Adam**: Okay, so if your place is really messy, you should do some housework, because doing housework really just means cleaning your house.

**Johnny**: Exactly, so Adam, when do you do housework?

**Adam**: I do housework on the weekend.

**Johnny**: I see, and do you like doing housework?

**Adam**: I don't really like doing housework, but I like doing housework better than doing homework.

**Johnny**: Oh, yes. So homework is work that a teacher gives students to do at home.

**Adam**: Yes, that's right! Maybe it's Math`n.数学` homework.  Maybe it's English homework, but you don't really have cleaning homework, because that is housework.

> messy `adj.混乱的`

**Johnny**: Right, and we do housework when our place is really messy.

**Adam**: Okay. So if you go to my place, you will probably see it's very messy. It means there are clothes on the floor. There are bowls`n.大酒杯` on the counter`n.柜台` and dirty dishes`(n.弄脏的餐具)`. Okay, so one thing we are going to talk about a lot today guys, is this word, "messy" and another word, "dirty`adj.下流的，卑鄙的；肮脏的；恶劣的；暗淡的`."

**Johnny**: Right, so there is a difference. If your bedroom is "messy," there's probably clothes everywhere. Your bed is not made. But if your room is "dirty," there's maybe some dirt`n.污垢，泥土；灰尘，尘土；下流话` on the floor. Things are not clean.

**Adam**: Right, exactly. So what does Mike say next?

> do the dishes `phr.洗餐具`

**Johnny**: Next he says, "You're right. I can do the dishes and clean the floor."

**Adam**: Wow, Mike sounds awesome`adj.令人敬畏的；使人畏惧的；可怕的；极好的`.

**Johnny**: Yeah. I want him as a roommate.`n.室友`

**Adam**: Okay, so doing the dishes. What are we doing when we're doing the dishes?

**Johnny**: Good question. So dishes are things we use to eat or cook, like chopsticks`n.筷子` or plates`n.盘子` or cups`n.杯子`.

**Adam**: And so when we do them, what are we doing?

**Johnny**: We are washing these things.

**Adam**: Right, so you can say wash the dishes, but usually we say do the dishes.

**Johnny**: Exactly, and there are two ways to do the dishes, we can wash the dishes with our hands or, if we're lucky, we can use a dishwasher`n.洗碗工；洗碟机`.

**Adam**: Oh, yes, a dishwasher is a really great machine that helps us wash or do the dishes.

**Johnny**: Right. So I don't like to wash the dishes with my hands, so I use a dishwasher.

**Adam**: Now, do you like tidying up?

> tidy up `phr.整理，收拾`

**Johnny**: Yeah, I like to tidy up. I usually listen to music while`conj.当....的时候` I tidy up.

**Adam**: Okay, So what is tidy up?

**Johnny**: Tidy up means to make something look good or neat`adj.灵巧的；整洁的；优雅的；齐整的；未掺水的；平滑的`.

**Adam**: So before we talked about a really messy bedroom with lots of clothes everywhere, if you tidy up your bedroom, it means you put the clothes away`adv.离去，离开；在远处`.

**Johnny**: Right, so people might say, "My bedroom is so messy. I need to tidy up."

**Adam**: Right. Now sometimes you will hear people say "tidy up the living room" like we hear Kate say, but you will also hear people say "tidy the living room up." It's the same thing.

**Johnny**: So I can say, "Can you help me tidy up the living room?" or I can say, "Can you help me tidy the living room up?"

> laundry `n.待洗的衣服`

**Adam**: Okay, so now we've talked about doing lots of dirrerent housework like doing the dishes or tidying up. The next bit of housework that Kate and Mike talk about is the laundry`n.洗衣店，洗衣房；要洗的衣服；洗熨；洗好的衣服`.

**Johnny**: The laundry, yes. So the laundry is dirty clothes that we need to wash.

**Adam**: Yes, so before we said that you can say wash the dishes or do the dishes, they're both fine. But when we talk about washing clothes we usually say, do the laundry.

**Johnny**: Yeah. So we can say, do the laundry or wash the clothes. They're the same thing.

**Adam**: That's right, they are. You can say I have so much laundry.

**Johnny**: Yeah, or I need to do my laundry.

**Adam**: Right, or "have you done the laundry?" which is what Mike says in today's dialogue. And that is today's grammar point. So we're going to talk about that later.

> turn `n.轮次、轮到你`

**Johnny**: Okay, but it looks like Kate hasn't done the laundry. She says, "No, I haven't. I thought it was your turn."

**Adam**: Okay, your turn! It's not my turn. It's your turn.

**Johnny**: Oh, it's my time to do it?

**Adam**: Right, so it's your time to do something, so I could say, "I did it last time. Now it's your turn."

**Johnny**: Oh, it's my turn to do the dishes.

**Adam**: Yeah! It's your turn to do the dishes. I did them last time.

**Johnny**: Okay, so that's a good sentence to use "it's your turn to do something. I did something last time."

**Adam**: Right, and it's not always about doing housework. It could be about more fun things too, like eating dinner with your friends.

**Johnny**: Right, you can say "It's your turn to pay. I paid last time."

**Adam**: It's your turn to pay. I paid last time. Okay, well Mike says, "No, it's not my turn. I did it last week."

**Johnny**: Yeah, and then Kate remembered. She goes, "Oh, you're right and I'll do it atter I clean."

> garbage `n.垃圾`

**Adam**: Then Mike says, "Cool, I'll take out the garbage."

**Johnny**: Okay, so let's look at this word "garbage " first.

**Adam**: Okay, "garbage" it smells very bad.

**Johnny**: So it's like old food, dirty stuff, anything we don't want.

**Adam**: Right, now you will also hear words like rubbish or trash.

**Johnny**: They all means the same thing and they all end up in the same place.

> take out `phr.拿出`

**Adam**: That's right, and you also need to take them out.

**Johnny**: Right. So if we take out of the garbage we take the  garbage outside our house.

**Adam**: Right, maybe you put it onto the street. Maybe you put it into a garbage can. The most important thing is you are taking it out.

**Johnny**: Exactly, so you can ask someone, "Hey, can you take out the garbage?"

**Adam**: I took out the garbage yesterday.

**Johnny**: Oh, it's my turn.

**Adam**: It's your turn to take out the garbage.

**Johnny**: Okay, I'll take out the garbage. You tidy up the kitchen.

**Adam**: Okay, that sounds good.

**Johnny**: Okay. Well, it looks like we're at the end of our dialogue,  so why don't we talk about our garmmar point today?

**Adam**: Sounds good.

**Johnny**: So today's grammar point is the present perfect tense. This is kind of a weird tense because it's a past tense. It's the way we talk about the past, but its name is the present perfect tense.

**Adam**: Right. So we use this tense to describe`vt.描述，形容；描绘` something that happened in the past but affects the present.

**Johnny**: Right. So it's about both the past and the present and now.

**Adam**: Exactly. Let's look at an example. I can say, "I've hurt my leg, so I can't go to school today."

**Johnny**: Okay, I've hurt my leg, not I hurt my leg. I've hurt my leg, so I can't go to school today.

**Adam**: Right, so you did something in the past: you hurt your leg. But it affercts`v.影响` now: you can't go to school.

**Adam**: Okay. So let's look at the example from today's lesson.

**Johnny**: Sure, so Mike asked, "Have you done the laundry?"

**Adam**: Okay, so he's asking if Kate did something in the past.

**Johnny**: Right, but it affects the housework they are doing now.

**Adam**: Right. Now Kate said, "No, I haven't." So we can guess that they have a little more housework to do now.

**Johnny**: Right, and she should have said, "Yes, I have" if she did the housework.

**Adam**: Right. Now she can also just say "yes" or "no." Those are both fine too.

**Johnny**: Yes, that's right! Okay, let's do one more example. I can say, "I've finished my homework, so I'm going to bed."

**Adam**: So you've finished something in the past, but it affects now.

**Johnny**: Right. I finished my homework in the past, but I can go to bed now.

**Adam**: Okay. These are great examples, but the one that we hear the most is this question, "have you eaten?"

**Johnny**: We hear that a lot. And you can say, "Yes, I have" or "No, not yet."

**Adam**: That's right, okay! Well, one other really important thing to remember when we use the present perfect tense, we don't say when we did it.

**Johnny**: Right. I can't say "I've finished my homework this morning."

**Adam**: Or "I've finished my homework in 1992."

**Johnny**: Right, so we can't add time.

**Adam**: Right, the time is not important.

**Johnny**: Exactly, so make sure to check out our grammar section for some more explanation and examples.

**Adam**: Okay, and that's the end of today's grammar point. Now let's listen to the dialogue between Kate and Mike one more time.

**Johnny**: Okay.
