## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身 

**Lisa**: Hey everyone, welcome back to OpenLanguage. You're listening to A2 lesson. My name is Lisa.

**Adam**: And my name is Adam.

**Lisa**: So Adam, what are we talking about today?

**Adam**: Well, we are talking about how to introduce yourself at an event.

**Lisa**: Right. When you meet people at an event like a party, you have to talk about yourself. You tell them your name and you talk about your work.

**Adam**: Right. But sometimes it can be very hard to start the conversation`(n.交谈；会话)`.

**Lisa**: Yes, so today we will learn about that and we'll learn to introduce ourselves`(pron.我们自己)` naturally`(adv.自然地)`.

**Adam**: Okay.

**Lisa**: Now. Let's listen to the dialogue.



### 核心对话

**A**: Sorry, I didn't catch your name earlier`(adv.之前，早些时候)`. I'm Bob. Nice to meet you. `对不起，我之前没听清你的名字。我交 Bob, 很高兴认识你。`

**B**: Hi Bob. I'm Sue. I work in education. What about you? `嗨，Bob。我是 Sue。我在教育行业工作。你呢？`

**A**: I'm an English teacher, but I'm starting law school next year. `我是一名英语老师，但我明年要去法律学院读书。`

**B**: That's wonderful! Do you plan on becoming a lawyer? `那真是太棒了！你打算成为一名律师吗？`

**A**: Yup! That's the goal. `是的！那是我的目标！`

**B**: Oh, let me introduce you to my co-worker, Oliver. `哦，让我来给你介绍一下我的同事，Oliver。`

**C**: Hi Bob. I'm Oliver. `嗨，Bob。我是 Oliver`

**A**: Hi Oliver! It's nice to meet you both! `嗨 Oliver,认识你俩我很高兴！`



## 03.对话精讲

**Lisa**: Okay, we are back. So we have three people talking today: Bob, Sue, and Oliver, and I really like how Bob starts this.

**Adam**: Yeah, me too. It sounds very natural. He says, "Sorry, I didn't catch your name earlier. I'm Bob. Nice to meet you."

**Lisa**: So "I didn't catch your name" means "I didn't hear your name."

**Adam**: Right. Because "catch" sometimes means "hear." For example, he spoke too fast, so I couldn't catch his name.

**Lisa**: Or she talked too quietly, so I didn't catch what she said.

**Adam**: Or sometimes we just forget a person's name, but we don't really want to say "Hi, I forgot your name."

**Lisa**: Yeah, it's just better to say "Sorry, I didn't catch your name."

**Adam**: Right. But next Bob says, "I'm Bob. Nice to meet you." He could say, "My name is Bob." But "I am Bob" is more natural and friendly.

**Lisa**: Yes, but what is her name?

> education `n.教育`

**Adam**: Well, she says, "Hi Bob. I'm Sue. I work in education. What about you?"

**Lisa**: Okay, so education is about teaching and helping others to learn.

**Adam**: Right.

**Lisa**: So you'll hear education or education.

**Adam**: Education /ˌedʒəˈkeɪʃən/, /ˌedʒuˈkeɪʃən/. They are both ok. And like Lisa says, they're both about teaching and helping others to learn.

**Lisa**: So maybe she is a teacher or maybe she just works in a school.

**Adam**: There are so many different jobs in education.

**Lisa**: Yeah, and we always say it this way, "I work in education."

**Adam**: We're not really talking about where she works or what building she works in. We're just talking about this idea, so you could say "I work in sales."

**Lisa**: Yeah, or "I work in business."

**Adam**: Right. Now, what about Bob?

**Lisa**: Well, he's a teacher, so he also works in education, but he's also going back to school because he wants to change his job.

**Adam**: Right, he says "I'm starting law school next year."

**Lisa**: Yeah, he uses "I'm starting" to talk about the future.

**Adam**: And we use this a lot with school, right? I'm starting school.

**Lisa**: Yeah, exactly, or I'm starting a new job.

**Adam**: Right.

**Lisa**: But this is our grammar point today, so we will talk about that at the end. Let's go back to Bob.

**Adam**: Okay, well, Bob says "He's going to law school." This is the place where you study the law.

> law `n.法律`

**Lisa**: Laws are like the rules for your country. So in Canada, you have to be nineteen to drink beer or wine.

**Adam**: Right, but in America, you have to be twenty-one to drink beer or wine.

**Lisa**: Right, that's the rule. That's the law.

**Adam**: That's the law, and of course, there are so many laws. You can't kill people.

**Lisa**: Yeah, you can't do A, B, C, D .....

**Adam**: Right, right, right, right.

**Lisa**: Now, if you want to study the laws, right? You go to law school. 

**Adam**: And one really famous law school is Harvard`(n.哈佛大学)` Law School.

> lawyer `n.律师`

**Lisa**: And when you're finished, maybe you will become a lawyer. That's the job.

**Adam**: Right, and lawyers make a lot of money.

**Lisa**: Well, if you went to Harvard Law School, then yes.

**Adam**: Yes, yes, yes. The world the "law" or "laws" sounds like /ɑː/. But the word "lawyer" sounds like /ˈɑːjɚ/.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so it's like "lawyer," not "liar."

**Adam**: Well, some lawyers are liars. That's right.

**Lisa**: And we'll see "lawyer" in the next line when Sue says, "That's wonderful! Do you plan on becoming a lawyer?"

> plan on `phr.计划，打算`

**Adam**: Right, "plan on," this is what you say when someone starts a new job or decides to go back to school.

**Lisa**: Yeah, we use it to talk about our future plans.

**Adam**: It's always "do you plan on doing someting."

**Lisa**: Yeah, like "she plans on becoming a singer."

**Adam**: Right, or you could plan on becoming a lawyer.

**Lisa**: Now you can say, "He plans on getting a new job," but you could also say, "He plans to get a new job."

**Adam**: Ah, okay, so that's very important. Let's repeat that one more time, "you can plan on doing something" or "you can plan to do something."

**Lisa**: Yeah, it's the same. Okay, but moving on here, what does Bob say?

> goal `n.目标`

**Adam**: He says, "Yup! That's the goal."

**Lisa**: Great phrase here. It's similar to saying, "That's the plan. That's what I want to do."

**Adam**: Yeah, because your goal is what you want to do, or maybe what you want to get.

**Lisa**: Yeah, it's like your dream.

**Adam**: So for your guys, maybe your goal is to speak English very well.

**Lisa**: Yeah, or you might have career`n.生涯；职业；事业` goals like Bob. For example, your goal could be to become a doctor.

**Adam**: Right. And other people like knowing about these things. They like to know about your plans. They like to know about your goals for the future.

**Lisa**: That's right, but it's hard to talk for a long time, right?  Sometimes you don't have anything to say. So when what happens, you can introduce your co-workers.

**Adam**: Ah, yes, and that is what Sue does here. She says, "Let me introduce you to my co-worker, Oliver."

> introduce `v.介绍`

**Lisa**: Yes, so "introduce," we talked about this a little bit in the beginning. It just means to say "Hi, my name is blah blah blah. I wok in blah blah blah."

**Adam**: Right, so you can introduce yourself or you can introduce another person like a friend or a co-worker.

> co-worker `n.同事`

**Lisa**: Yes, introduce A to B. We always say "to." She introduced Bob to her co-worker Oliver.

**Adam**: So that means she works with Oliver, right?

**Lisa**: Yes, so your co-workers is the person you work with. "Co-" means together and a worker is a person who works.

**Adam**: Right. Now the co-worker Oliver, he also has some things to say. He also wants to introduce himself. So he says "Hi Bob, I'm Oliver."

**Lisa**: And Bob ends with a great line. He says "Hi Oliver. It's nice to meet you both."

**Adam**: That's right. So earlier we heard "Nice to meet you," but you can also say "It's nice to meet you."

**Lisa**: Yeah, it's the same. And Bob is talking to Sue and Oliver. So he added "both." "It's nice to meet you both."

**Adam**: Okay, well. Now that we have been introduced to Bob, Sue, and Oliver. Let's take a look at today's grammar point.

**Lisa**: All right, let's do that.

**Adam**: So today's grammar is using the present continuous to talk about the future.

**Lisa**: Okay, so before you go, what is the present continuous? All it means js just "I am doing."

**Adam**: Yes, like right now, you are listening to OpenLanguage.

**Lisa**: That'r right. Right now, I am sitting on a chair.

**Adam**: Yes, but we can also use this to talk about the future.

**Lisa**: Yes, in fact`(n.事实；实际；真相)`, we use this to talk about the future so much.

**Adam**: In this dialogue, we heard "I'm starting law school next year."

**Lisa**: "Next year," that's not right now.

**Adam**: It really isn't, right? Or I could say "I'm seeing a movie on Friday."

**Lisa**: Yeah, the plane is arrving at three PM.

**Lisa**: Yes, so this is all in the futrue and we have a future time there.

**Adam**: Yes.

**Lisa**: But we can also use this without a time.

**Adam**: Yeah, we don't need a time, so I could just say something like "Yeah. I'm coming."

**Lisa**: Yeah, like "I'm coming to the party tonight."

**Adam**: Right, right, right or "I'm buying a house."

**Lisa**: Yeah, you're not actually paying for it right now.

**Adam**: Right now.

**Adam**: Or another great example is a woman can say, "I'm having a baby." It doesn't mean right now.

**Lisa**: Yeah, I know, like six months later.

**Adam**: Right, I'm having a babay.

**Lisa**: That's right.

**Adam**: Now that's the first part of our grammar point. The second part is about the word "will."

**Lisa**: Yes, what is the difference between the present continuous and "will"? Well, when you use the present continuous like "I'm starting," it sounds sure, right? You sound really sure, but "will," we can use this when, well, we're not sure.

**Adam**: Not sure.

**Lisa**: Like I wouldn't say "Maybe I'm going to the party."

**Adam**: Yeah, I'll say "Maybe I'll go."

**Lisa**: Yeah, and I can't say "Maybe he is coming to the meeting."

**Adam**: Yeah, "maybe he'll come to the meeting."

**Lisa**: Yeah, so it's always nore natural to use "will" when you're not sure and use the present continuous when you are sure.

**Adam**: Right. I'm going to the party and he is coming to the meeting.

**Lisa**: Exactly! Okay, now we have some more examples for you. So please go ahead ad look at the grammar section.

**Adam**: But for now, we have finished our dialogue. We have finished the grammar section, so why don't we go ahead and listen to the dialogue one more time.

**Lisa**: All right, let's do that!

------

**Lisa**: Okay, we are back. So we learned a lot of good words and phrases`n.短语；词组` today, but let's talk more about introducing ourselves naturally.

**Adam**: Okay, so in the lesson today, Sue said, "I work in education" and Bob said, "I'm a teacher."

**Lisa**: Right, so no one said "my job is a teacher."

**Adam**: Right, you can't really say that. It doesn't sound natural. We always say I work in a field lke "I work in business" or "I work in engineering"

**Lisa**: Yeah.

**Adam**: Or "I'm a businessman" or "I'm an engineer."

**Lisa**: Right, it's always good to tell people more about yourself too, like "I plan on going back to school."

**Adam**: Or "I'm starting a new business this year." Okay, guys, what about you? Can you introduce yourselves to all your friends at OpenLanguage?

**Lisa**: Do you plan on going back to school? Do you plan on staring a new business this year?

**Adam**: Yeah, let us know in the comments and we'll look forward to reading them.

**Lisa**: Okay, guys, as always, thanks for listening and we'll see you next time.

**Lisa**: Yep, see you then.
