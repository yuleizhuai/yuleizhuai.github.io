## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身

**Adam**: Hey, guys. Welcome back to Open Language, this is Adam.

**Connor**: And this is Connor.

**Adam**: And today, we are talking about something that is so important when you go to a new city or new place.

**Connor**: Uh-huh, yeah. When you get lost, how do find where you are going?

**Adam**: Right! So the way you find it usually is you have to ask somebody for directions.

**Connor**: Uh-huh, and it's a little bit scary`adj.可怕的，恐怖的`, so we have a dialogue here, uh, between a tourist and a local, somebody from that city.

**Adam**: OK, and so basically the tourist is lost and the local is going to help her.

**Connor**: Alright, why don't we take a listen?

**Adam**: Sounds good!



### 核心对话

**A**: Excuse me. How do I get to the mall? I'm from out of town. `打扰一下，怎么去商场呀？我是外地来的。`

**B**: Oh, it's easy. Just walk up the street until you hit Park Avenue, then make a right. `哦，很简单。沿着这条街走，一直到公园大道然后右转。`

**A**: Okay. Do I keep going? `好，我是继续往前走吗？`

**B**: Yes, walk there more blocks. The mall will be on your left. It's across from the subway station. You can't miss it. `是的，再走三个街区。商场会在你的左手边，地铁站对面，你不会错过的。`

**A**: Okay, I think I've got it. Thanks! `好的，我知道了。谢谢！`

**B**: No problem. Happy shopping! `没事，祝你购物愉快哦！`



## 03.对话精讲

> mall `n.商场`

**Connor**: OK! So we have the tourist. She is lost and so she asks somebody: "Excuse me, how do I get to the mall?"

**Adam**: OK, so the mall, I think we all probably know the mall. It's place where you go shopping.

**Connor**: Uh-huh, shopping mall.

**Adam**: It's a shopping mall.

**Connor**: Yeah.

**Adam**: I don't think I've ever actually said shopping mall.

**Connor**: Yeah, me neither. Some people say shopping center.

**Adam**: Shopping center.

**Connor**: But really they're all the same place, right?

> How do I get to `phr.怎么去`

**Adam**: Right, so it's interesting here. Because uhm, you might think we should say, oh, "How do I go to the mall?"

**Connor**: Right, yeah, it's weird`adj.怪异的；不可思议的；超自然的` if you ask that question, I would kind of think about "Would you go on a bike`n.自行车，脚踏车`? Would you go in a taxi? "

**Adam**: Exactly!

**Connor**: When we ask how to get or how to arrive somewhere, we use this: how do I get?

**Adam**: Right!

**Connor**: In fact, we could also say "How do you get to the mall?"

**Adam**: Oh! That's right! Because "you" means like, like everybody!

**Connor**: Right! Exactly! Now, of course. The reason why this lady does not know how to get to the mall is because she is not local.

> out of town `phr.外地的`

**Adam**: That's right! She's from out of the town. So this means that you're not from there. You are maybe from a different country or just a different city.

**Connor**: Right! Interesting because even if we are in a city like a very big city, like New York or Los Angeles, you would still say "I'm from out of town."

**Adam**: Right! This is a chunk, doesn't change, right?

**Connor**: Uh, um, someone who is from out of town, in this case, thr tourist. She could be called an out-of-towner.

**Adam**: Out-of-towner.

**Connor**: That's right!

**Adam**: Of if my friend goes on a business trip, I might say "Oh, my friend, he's out of town!"

**Connor**: Right! Exactly!

**Adam**: OK! So this local guy who is not from out of town. He is very helpful and he explains to the tourist how to get there.

> up the street `phr.沿着街`

**Connor**: Right! He says "Well, it's easy. Just walk up the street until you hit Park Avenne, then make a right."

**Adam**: Okay! So walk up the street. Could he say "walk down the street"?

**Connor**: Yes, he could have. Basically they are the same. But if the street is like on a hill then, you know, you might say up, if it's going up, it's closer to the sky.

**Adam**: It's closer to the sky, yeah.

**Connor**: Yeah! It's really interesting because sometimes, even with people in my family, I will say go down to somewhere and they will say go up to somewhere.

**Adam**: Yeah, it's, it's funny! It's the same. It just means go straight!

**Connor**: Go straight!

**Connor**: Exactly.

> hit `v.到达`

**Connor**: Now what about this "hit"?

**Adam**: Right! Nobody is hitting anybody. It just means arrive`vi.到达` or reach`vi 达到`.

**Connor**: Reach somewhere, yeah. So it doesn't need to be a place, a street. It could be when you hit 30.

**Adam**: Yeah.

**Connor**: Your body starts to hurt.

**Adam**: Yeah! Or when Open Language hits a billion users.

**Connor**: Wow! Then we can retire`vi.退休`.

> avenue `n.大道`

**Adam**: For sure. So when you arrive at, when you come to Park Avenue. Now, this is the name of a street. It's not a park. It's a street name. It's  actually quite a popular name for a steet.

**Connor**: Uh-huh, yeah. Sounds like where, where a lot of rich people would live.

**Adam**: Yeah, but we don't call a street, we call an avenue.

**Connor**: Avenue. Right!  So avenues are very big?

**Adam**: Yeah, big long roads.

**Connor**: Exactly.

**Adam**: Major roads and cities.

**Connor**: Exactly. And just to remind you guys about the pronunciation. It's avenue. So what does she have to do after she hits Park Avenue?

> make a right `phr.右转`

**Adam**: Oh, she has to make a right.

**Connor**: Make a right?

**Adam**: Oh, she's not making anything. She's turning right.

**Connor**: Turn right. Exactly! He could even say go right.

**Adam**: Yeah. Or there's another slang word which is hang a right.

**Connor**: Hang a right. Yeah, when I'm in a taxi, I always say this, oh, just hang a right up ahead.

**Adam**: Uh-huh. It's very casual.

**Connor**: Right, exactly.

> keep going `phr.继续走`

**Adam**: So after she makes a right, she doesn't know what to do next. She says "Well, do I keep going?"

**Connor**: Keep going, this, yeah. I just love this phrase "keep going". We don't really need to talk about it too much today. But, you know, in life, when you're sad, when you're down, keep going!

**Adam**: Yeah! Don't stop.

**Connor**: Don't stop.

> blocks `n.街区`

**Adam**: And this case, she also should not stop. She has to walk three more blocks.

**Connor**: OK! That sounds like it could be pretty far.

**Adam**: Yeah, well, a block is basically like, what we sometimes say, a city block?

**Connor**: Right.

**Adam**: It's just from one street or intersection to the next one.

**Connor**: Right, or if you look at a map, most cities in North America, they're very straight. It's all squares.

**Adam**: Squares, yeah, yeah, so a blcok is one of those squares.

**Connor**: Right, exactly. If you don't want to think about blocks or squares. You can also think about intersection.

**Adam**: That's right. Yeah, like go three more intersections`n.交集，交叉点` or three more streets even.

**Connor**: Exactly. So Park Avenue is the one straight line. And if you looked on the map, there might be Connor Street.

**Adam**: Adma Street.

**Connor**: And Lisa's Street.

**Adam**: That's a good name, I think.

**Connor**: A good, good street name, I think.

**Adam**: Yeah.

> on your left `phr.左手边`

**Connor**: And then the local, he says "The mall will be on your left." This is after walking three more blocks.

**Adam**: OK, so the mall will be. He could also say "The mall is on your left."

**Connor**: Yeah, is on your left, for sure.

**Adam**: Doesn't really matter. The important thing is on your left, on your right.

**Connor**: Right! I mean he could have said on the left. But you know, if I'm facing a different direction, then we should say on your left.

**Adam**: Right. Sometimes it's confusing. Because I mean, the mall doesn't really have arms.

**Adam**: But with another person. Maybe you're trying to get someone to help you grab a magazine. Can you, oh, can you grab that magazine? No, no, the one on the left.

**Connor**: Yeah, yeah.

**Adam**: Or they might think my left?

**Connor**: Yeah. No, not my left.

**Adam**: My left? No, no, no, your left. No, no, no. But in this case, it's OK, there probably won't be very much confusion`n.混淆；混乱；困惑`. And even if there is, he gives one other piece`n.块；件` of information.

> across from `phr.对面`

**Connor**: Yeah, it's across from the subway station.

**Adam**: OK, so the subway station is on one side and the mall is on the other side.

**Connor**: The other side. And we could even say the opposite`adj.相反的`.

**Adam**: Right. Or we could say it's facing.

**Connor**: Oh! That's a good one. Ya, it's facing the subway station.

**Adam**: Uh, exactly.

> subway station `n.地铁站`

**Connor**: And subway station, of course, that's where you ride the subway.

**Adam**: Ride the subway, yes. Um, now, of course, in North America, we use this word subway a lot. It could be a metro station. If we were in London, England, they might say a tube station.

**Connor**: Yeah, or the underground`adj.地下的`.

**Adam**: The underground.

**Adam**: Exactly. So there's so many different words for subway station or for subway. But they all mean the same thing.

**Connor**: Right, so he gives a lot of good information here about how to get there. But he says one more thing.

**Adam**: Uh, that's right. He says "You can't miss it."

**Connor**: Right, so miss here means that you can't pass it without seeing it.

**Adam**: Right. You go too far.

**Connor**: Too far, yeah.

**Adam**: Like speaking of subways, sometimes I'm on the subway and maybe I'm reading an article, watching a movie and I miss my stop.

**Connor**: Yeah, so it doesn't really mean can't. It just means it's so easy to find and easy to see. If you pass it, then maybe you're not paying attention.

**Adam**: You're not paying attention, yeah, exactly, yeah. I mean I say this a lot. I love to help people who are lost here in Vancouver`n.温哥华`.

**Adam**: And I always say this at the end.

**Connor**: Oh, yeah.

**Adam**: You can't miss it! You can't miss it!

**Connor**: Yeah! So the local`adj.当地的` gave some really good directions here. And of course, so the tourist lady, she says "I think I've got it."

**Adam**: I think I've got it.

**Connor**: So this just means I understand.

**Adam**: Right. And you guys probably have heard this once or twice. A lot of native speakers love to just say "Got it."

**Connor**: Got it.

**Adam**: Got it. Yeah.

**Connor**: But if you just say "got it" to a stranger. That could sound kind of rude.

**Adam**: Yeah, you gotta be a little careful.

**Connor**: Right, so "I got it" is Okay, even more polite, I've got it.

**Adam**: Yeah. Grammatically correct!

**Connor**: Exactly. But she could have said I got it.

**Adam**: I got it.

**Connor**: Or just got it.

**Adam**: Yeah. But of course you always put thanks on the end as well. Thank you. Thanks.

**Connor**: Yeah, for sure. And if someone says thanks to you, probably should say something like, no problem back to them.

**Adam**: No problem is just like you are welcome.

**Connor**: You are welcome.

**Adam**: And of course. A little word at the end, Happy shopping!

**Connor**: I like this.

**Adam**: I like any time we see. Because we all know, Happy Birthday, Happy Valentine's day. 

**Connor**: Happy riding or Happy fishing!

**Adam**: Happy fishing, yeah, so why don't we listen to that one more time?

**Connor**: Uh, and we could wish our listeners.

**Adam**: Happy listening.

**Connor**: Happy listening.

------

**Connor**: OK, so we learned a lot of good vocabulary. This is really really important when you're learning English because there are just so many useful words and phrases in here.

**Adam**: Yeah. And let's face`vt.面对；面向；承认` it. All of us get lost sometimes and we are going to need to ask for help.  Interesting in this lesson, how the tourist, the person asking for help was a lady.

**Connor**: Yeah, that's funny because guys usually don't like to ask for help.

**Adam**: We sure don't, yeah. I mean I have seen so many guys in Vancouver`n.温哥华（加拿大主要港市）`, actually in many cities.

**Adam**: Looking at a map.

**Adam**: Looking very lost.

**Adam**: And there is no way they are going to ask for help, but then you see their wives.

**Connor**: Their wives, yeah.

**Adam**: Or their girlfriends or just their friends, you know, running around, "Excuse me, how do I get to the museum?"

**Adam**: How do I get to the subway station?

**Connor**: Yeah, and the husband says, "Oh, it's okay, I got it!"

**Adam**: I got it! I got it! I got it. But he doesn't. He doesn't

**Connor**: What about you guys? Have you ever been lost in a new city or a new country?

**Adam**: Um, do you have any funny stories about being lost or maybe about talking to the locals, about how to get to where you want to go?

**Connor**: Yeah, let us know in those comments and we look forward to seeing them until then we'll talk to you later.

**Adam**: Alright! Bye guys!
