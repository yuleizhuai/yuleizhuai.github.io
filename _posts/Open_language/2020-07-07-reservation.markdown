## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身 

**Lisa**: Hey guys! Welcome to OpenLanguage. This is Lisa.

**Adam**: And this is Adam.

**Lisa**: Okay, Adam, what are we talking about today?

**Adam**: Well, we are make a dinner reservation.

**Lisa**: Yes. So we are going to call a restaurant and reserve a table.

**Adam**: Because sometimes you go to the restaurant, and there are so many people there, and you don't have a place to eat.

**Lisa**: That's right. So in today's dialogue, we have a waitress`n.女服务员` and Mark. And Mark is goint to be calling the restaurant. So why don't we go ahead and listen to that dialogue?

**Adam**: Sounds good.



### 核心对话

**A**: Joe's Kitchen, how may I help you? `Joe 的厨房，我能为你做些什么？`

**B**: Hi there, I'd like to make a reservation for tonight at 7:00, please. `你好，我想预约今晚7:00的座位。`

**A**: I'm sorry sir, but we are fully booked until 8:00. `不好意思，先生，8 点前的座位都已经预约满了。`

**B**: 8:00 is fine, then. `8点也可以。`

**A**: Okay. How many people will be in your group? `好的。你们会有多少人？`

**B**: There will be 4 of us. `我们会有 4 个人。`

**A**: Excellent. And could I have a name for the resevation? `好的。您能告诉我本次预定人的名字吗？`

**B**: Sure, it's Mark. `好的，叫 Mark。`



## 03.对话精讲

> kitchen `n.厨房`

**Lisa**: Okay. And we are back. This dialogue starts with the waitress, and she says "Joe's Kitchen, how may I help you?"

**Adam**: Yeah. This sounds like someone would say when they answer the telephone, "Joe's Kitchen, how may I help you?"

**Lisa**: That's right. So "Joe's Kitchen," this is the name of the restaurant, right?

**Adam**: Right. This is not a kitchen in Joe's home.

**Lisa**: No, it is not.

**Adam**: I guess it could be. But I'm not sure who would relly want to go to Joe's home into his kitchen. In any case, this is just a name of a restaurant.

**Lisa**: Yeah. And that is why it has a capital`n.首都，省会；资金；大写字母；资本家` "K" here.

**Adam**: Right. Now when you work at a restaurant, and if you answer the phone at a restaurant, you will often say this phrase "How may I help you?"

**Lisa**: Or "How can I help you?"

**Adam**: Right. "May" is maybe a little bit more pilite than "can," but they're both fine.

> help `v.帮助`

**Lisa**: Now let's look at this verb a little bit more, "help."

**Adam**: Um.

**Lisa**: A lot of people have questions about the proposition`n.命题；提议；主题；议题` . Do I say "help you do something" or "help you to do something?"

**Adam**: Right. And the truth is, guys, it doesn't matter. This lady could be helping Joe make a reservation or she could be helping him to make a reservation. It's the same thing.

**Lisa**: Yes, so don't worry about it and choose the one that you like better.

> make a reservation `phr.预约`

**Adam**: Now I just said the key phrase from today's lesson, "make a reservation."

**Lisa**: So when you make a reservation, you call the restaurant and ask them to keep a table for you.

**Adam**: Right. And after you have a reservation, then you have a reservation.

> reservation `n.预约`

**Lisa**: Exactly. So "reservation" is a noun, and the verb is to "reserve."

**Adam**: That's right. So what they are doing here is reserving a table.

**Lisa**: You could also reserve tickets. You could reserve a hotel room. Well, I guess you could also reserve a meeting room.

**Adam**: That's right. If you work at a big company, you will probaly need to reserve all kinds of meeting rooms.

**Lisa**: Yes. So here, he says "I'd like to make a reservation for tonight at 7:00/"

**Adam**: Okay. When you make a reservation, always want to say "for."

**Lisa**: Yes. But we will talk more about this at the end when we talk about the grammar.

**Adam**: Okay, So what does the waitress say to Mark, after he asks if he can make a reservation?

> booked `adj.已预约的`

**Lisa**: Well, she says, "I'm sorry sir, but we are fully booked until 8:00."

**Adam**: So Lisa already said that another word for "reserve" that's pretty much the same meaning, is  "book."

**Lisa**: Yes. So you could book a table, but here it says "We are booked."

**Adam**: Okay. This is an adjective, which means there are no tables.

**Lisa**: Yes, also within an airplane, if the flight is booked, it means that there are no more seats on this flight.

> fully `adv.完全地`

**Adam**: Right. And Lisa already talked about hotel rooms. They could be booked as well. Now the other really important word in the sentence is "fully."

**Lisa**: Yes. This is an adverb`n.副词` and it means "completely`adv.完全地，彻底地；完整地`."

**Adam**: Right.

**Lisa**: All booked.

**Adam**: All, right? So if you're thinking about that plane with all those people on it, that plane is fully booked.  Or that hotel you wanted to sty at but couldn't, it was fully booked.

**Lisa**: That's right. We also have the adjective "full." I could say, the room was full, and it means that there are so many people in this room and we can't put any more people.

**Adam**: No more people.

**Lisa**: No more people.

**Adam**: Now, "fully" as an adverb, we can use this with so many other words. I think about my phone. When I have to charge my phone, I'd like it to be fully charged.

**Lisa**: Yeah. Or when you understand something, you want to fully understand what someone is saying.

**Adam**: Right. Not just a little bit. You want to understand everything.

**Lisa**: Well, looks like this restaurant is fully booked until 8:00.

**Adam**: Okay. So another word there. We are going to talk about these words. Guys. don't worry. But, for now, let's talk about one other question that waitresses or people answering the phone at a restaurant will ask you, if you make a reservation.

> group `n.群，组`

**Lisa**: The waitresses will always say "How many people will be in your group?"

**Adam**: Right. They want to know how many people are coming. So "the group" is just a bunch`n.群；串` of people.

**Lisa**: Yep. So you could have a group of friends. Or if you're going to a restaurant, maybe you will be in a group of two.

**Adam**: Right. Now a lot of you guys really like to travel. Some of you like to travel, maybe with your friends, maybe with your family, and other people like to travel in group tours`v.游览`.

**Lisa**: Okay, those can actually be pretty fun.

**Adam**: They can be fun. You get to wear the same color hat and listen to the guy on the bus.

**Lisa**: But at lease you're not alone, right? You're in a group.

**Adam**: That's right. And, of course, there is one other group that is very important part of all of our lives, and that is the Wechat Group.

**Lisa**: Yeah. There're all different types of Wechat Group. There's an OpenLanguage Wechat Group, I think.

**Adam**: Oh, yeah, yeah. Exactly. My favorite part about Wechat group is when people send "hongbao."

**Lisa**: Oh, yes. Always the best part. Okay, but how many people are in Mark's group?

**Adam**: Well, there are four people in Mark's group. But, because the waitress asked "How many people will be in your group?," he ansers "There will be 4 of us."

**Lisa**: Yes. So this is a really good sentence to use, right? Whenever`conj.每当，无论何时` anyone asks you, "How many people will be in your group?" You can say, "There will be 5 of us. There will be 2 of us."

**Adam**: Right. "Of us" just means "together," "all together."

**Lisa**: Exactly. Now the waitress says, "Excellent. And could I have a name for the reservation?"

**Adam**: Oh, that's also very important. Might be the most important part.

**Lisa**: Yep. We already talked about reservation before, right? Now how does he answer this question?

**Adam**: He says, "It's Mark." Or "Sure, it's Mark."

**Lisa**: Yeah. You might be thinking, well, shouldn't he say "I'm Mark?"

**Adam**: "I'm Mark" or "My name is Mark." I guess you could say "My name is Mark." But it sounds a little strange`adj.奇怪的；陌生的；外行的`.

**Lisa**: Yeah. Here, he probably wants to say, "The name for the reservation is Mark," but that is really long.

**Adam**: Exactly. And you could also just say "Mark," but that's too short.

**Lisa**: Exactly. So it's best to just say, "Sure, it's Mark." or "Sure, it's Lisa."

**Adam**: Right. Okay, we said before that we were going to talk about these little words before times like 7:00 or 8:00. So, now it's probably the best time to do that, because it is our grammar point for today.

**Lisa**: Okay. So going back to his sentence, "I'd like to make a reservation for tonight at 7:00."

**Adam**: Okay. "At time" is probably one of the most common things. At 6:00. At 7:00.

**Lisa**: At 5:00.

**Adam**: At 5:00. But that is when we have a number. We don't say "at the morning," "at the evening."

**Lisa**: At Tuesday. We don't say that.

**Adam**: Right. But when we are saying that time, 7:00, 7:30, 10:30, it's usually "at," Now I already said we make a reservation for a time, so if you wanted to say make a reservation for 7:00, thats okay.

**Lisa**: Yeah. Can I say "I'd like to make a reservation at 7:00"?

**Adam**: Well, you can. But that makes me think that when you call the restaurant, it's 7:00.

**Lisa**: It' a little confusing`adj.混乱的；混淆的；令人困惑的`.

**Adam**: Right.

**Lisa**: So it's best to say, "I'd like to make a reservation for 7:00," or "I'd like to make a reservation for tonight at 7:00".

**Adam**: That's right. Now if all of the tables are fully booked, a waitress might say, "Oh, we are fully booked until 8:00."

**Lisa**: This is the word that we use to explain when something finishes. For example, "I could have a class until 3 PM."

**Adam**: Oh yeah. That's a good one. And if that class starts at 2 PM, you can say, "Oh, I have class at 2:00 until 3:00."

**Lisa**: Yes. But what does she mean, when she says "we are fully booked until 8:00"?

**Adam**: It means at 8:00, we are not fully booked.

**Lisa**: Yes. So she's booked maybe from 6:00 to 8:00 and then at 8:00. there are more tables.

**Adam**: Right. Now maybe this is Friday night, and maybe people really start coming to this restaurant at 8:00. In that case, we could say "we are not booked until 8:00."

**Lisa**: Yes. So before 8:00, you are free, and then atter 8:00, it gets really busy.

**Adam**: Okay. Well, guys, that is out grammar point for today. Make sure to check that out because it is super important.

**Lisa**: That's right. Now I think that it's about time for us to take another listen to that dialogue. What do you think?

**Adam**: Also super important.
