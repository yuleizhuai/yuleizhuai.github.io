### 课程热身 

**Connor**: Hi guys, welcome back to open language. This is Connor.

**Adam**: And this is Adam.

**Connor**: And today we have a nice elementary`adj.基本的；初级的` lesson for you, called convenience`n.便利；厕所；便利的事情` store run.

**Adam**: That's right. Convenience stores are very very useful, they're very convenient`adj.方便点；适当的；近便的；实用的`.

**Connor**: They're convenient.

**Adam**: Yeah. They are very convenient. But we're not talking about run as in "go for a run" today.

**Connor**: No, no, that's right. This is just when you go to the convenience store.

**Adam**: Right, exactly. And it can be quickly. Ah, as we will talk about later, but for now why don't we go ahead and listen to Cody and Jessica and find out what they are going to buy at the convenience store?

**Connor**: Alright!



### 核心对话

**A**: Hey Jessica, I'm going on a convenience store run. Do you need anything? `嘿 Jessica, 我要去一趟便利店。需要帮你带点什么吗？`

**B**: I'm almost out of tissues. Could you grab me a pack? `我的纸巾快用完了。能帮我带一包吗？`

**A**: Sure, no problem. You want a drink of something? `当然啦，没问题。你还要点饮料之类的吗？`

**B**: Um, I think I'm good. But could you get me some yogurt? `不用了。不过你能帮我带点酸奶吗？`

**A**: Okay. I'm going to get a few tea eggs too. Want one? `好啊。我还要买点茶叶蛋，你要吗？`

**B**: Yes! They are the perfect aternoon snack. Oh shoot, I left my wallet at home. `好呀！它们做下午茶零食很棒。糟了，我把钱包忘家里了。`

**A**: No problem. You can pay me back later! `没事儿，可以之后再还我。`



## 03.对话精讲

> convenience store `n.便利店`

**Connor**: Alright, so it looks like Cody is going on a convenience store run. So what is this exactly?

**Adam**: Well, like I said in the intro`n.介绍，简介`, run can mean lots of things.

**Connor**: Oh yeah.

**Adam**: It doesn't just mean walk or move quickly.

**Connor**: Yeah. But run here is more like a short trip.

**Adam**: Yeah, especially `adv.特别；尤其；格外` to buy something.

**Connor**: Yeah, yeah. Something sample, something small.

**Adam**: Yeah. So if I don't have any milk at home, I might say, "Oh, I need to go on a milk run."

**Connor**: Yeah, to go get some milk, some of the basic things.

**Adam**: Right. And it could be anything, right? When we were in Asia`n.亚洲`, I was in China, Connor was in Korea`n.韩国；朝鲜` . We needed visas`n.签证（visa 的复数）`. 

**Connor**: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

**Adam**: So sometimes we'd have to go on a visa run.

**Connor**: Right. And that meant`v.意味；打算（mean 的过去式和过去分词）；表示...的意思` going to an another country.

**Adam**: So it was maybe not as eays as goint to buy milk or eggs or just going to the convenience store, but it was still a quick trip.

**Connor**: Yeah. And the reason we use this a lot is because convenience stores, oh, they have many basic things that we need, like milk and eggs.

**Adam**: Exactly, exactly! They're usually a little bit more expensive as you guys all know. But of course, they are very very convenient.

**Connor**: Yeah. And so why is Cody going on a convenience store run?

**Adam**: Well, we don't really know. I mean he wants to buy something, but often times when we go on these runs, we also go for other people.

**Connor**: Oh, yeah yeah. That's right.

**Adam**: So Cody and Jessica they are probably at work together, and Cody is just a nice guy, so he's saying, "Jessica, do you need anything?"

> tissues `n.纸巾`

**Connor**:  Yes. And she does, she needs tissues.

> out of `phr.用完了`

**Adam**: That's right. In fact, she is almost out of tissues.

**Connor**: Out of tissues. So not outside, the tissues are not outside. It means she almost used all the tissues.

**Adam**: Right, she maybe has one or two or three, soon there will be no tissues.

**Connor**: Yeah. And this is such a common phrase you can be almost out of something or out of something.

**Adam**: Right. Or all out, kind of stresses that a bit, I'm all out of tissues.

**Connor**: Yeah. Now tissue you use for wiping`v.擦干；使消失（wipe 的 ing 形式）` your face if you have a cold. But what's the difference between tissue and napkin`n.餐巾；餐巾纸；尿布？`

**Adam**: We use napkins at the dinner table.

**Connor**: Yeah. And they are not always paper, right?

**Adam**: Right. Tissues are always paper.

**Connor**: Yeah! And I mean if you go to a fancy restaurant the napkins will be made of cloth`n.布；织物；桌布`.

**Adam**: Cloth? Yeah. Exactly.
