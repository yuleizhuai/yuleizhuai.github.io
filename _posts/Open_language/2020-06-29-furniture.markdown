## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身 

**Lisa**: Hey, everyone. Welcome back to OpenLanguage. This is Lisa.

**Adam**: And this is Adam.

**Lisa**: And you're listening to an A2 lesson, called "Shopping for furniture."

**Adam**: It really just means we are going to a store and we are buying furniture.

**Lisa**: So when you move into a new house, you need to shop for furniture like tables and beds.

**Adam**: Today we are going to learn about furniture we like, and furniture we don't like.

**Lisa**: In our dialogue, we have two people, Jess and Eric. They're going to be at a furniture store. Now, let's listen to the dialogue.



### 核心对话

**A**: Sweetie, can you come look at the furniture? `亲爱的，你能过来看看这些家具吗？`

**B**: Sure. Do you like the coffee table and shelf? There're nice. `当然。你喜欢这张咖啡桌和架子吗？它们很不错。`

**A**: Yeah, I think they'll look great in our living room. `是的，我觉得放在我们的客厅会很好看。`

**B**: What about this sofa? It feels so soft! `那这个沙发呢？它摸起来好软。`

**A**: It does. But, it also looks like the old sofa at your grandma's house. `确实。但是，它看起来也像你奶奶家的旧沙发。`

**B**: Ok, so do you prefer something more modern? `好吧，所以你想要更现代风格的吗？`

**A**: Yes. What about this one over here? `是的。这边的这件怎么样？`

**B**: It's perfect! Let's get that. `完美！我们买那个吧。`



## 03.对话精讲

> come look `phr.过来看看`

**Lisa**: We are back. So Eric and Jess are husband and wife, and it starts with Jess here. She says, "Sweetie, can you come look at the furniture?"

**Adam**: It sounds so sweet. "Sweetie, can you come look at the furniture?"

**Lisa**: Yeah, so this is something we often use when we're at a store, and we want someone to look at something.

**Adam**: Come here and look.

**Lisa**: Yes, so you could say "come and look," but it's easier just to say "come look."

**Adam**: Exactly. "Come" is a very special verb, beacuse you can put another verb after it. You don't need a "to," come to look or come looking. It's just "come look" or "come and look."

**Lisa**: We can also use other verbs, like "come watch a movie."

**Adam**: Come eat some food.

> furniture `n.家具`

**Lisa**: Yeah, but here we're in a store, and Jess says, "Can you come look at the furniture?"

**Adam**: "Furniture," this is the stuff that you need to buy for your house.

**Lisa**: Yes, the tables, the beds, the chairs. This is all furniture.

**Adam**: That's right. Most important, guys, we cannot say "furnitures." We can only say "pieces`n.工件零件；匹头，毛束` or furniture."

**Lisa**: Yes, because it is an uncountable noun.

**Adam**: Right

> coffee table `n.咖啡桌`

**Lisa**: She wants him to look at the furniture, and Eric says, "Sure. Do you like the coffee table and shelf? They're nice." 

**Adam**: "Coffee table," this is one of my favorite pieces of furniture.

**Lisa**: It's just a samll table that you can put coffee on when you're talking or watching TV.

**Adam**: Right, maybe you can put some books or magazines`n.杂志` on it.

**Lisa**: Yeah, and you can have a coffee table in your office, too.

**Adam**: I have a coffee table in every room.

**Lisa**: But we have a lot of different types of tables. We also have a dining`n.吃饭，进餐 v.吃饭（dine的现在分词）` table.

**Adam**: Or you can have a table in your kitchen. We call that the kitchen table.

**Lisa**: Now, do we say "studying table?"

**Adam**: You can study at a table, but usually we study at a desk.

> shelf `n.架子`

**Lisa**: That's right. Here Eric is asking about the coffee table and the shelf.

**Adam**: When I think about a "shelf," I think about a bookshelf`n.书架`.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so you put books on it, usually.

**Adam**: Usually. You can put other stuff on a shelf. Maybe your kitchen has a shelf. Maybe your bathroom has a shelf.

**Lisa**: Yeah, or a lot of people put pictures on shelves`n.架子（shelf 的复数）`

**Adam**: Yeah.

**Lisa**: So I just said "shelves" there. When we have one, it's one "shelf," but we say two "shelves."

**Adam**: Okay, one shelf, two shelves. Got it. What does Jess think about this shelf and coffee table?

> living room `n.客厅`

**Lisa**: She says, "Yeah, I think they'll look great in our living room."

**Adam**: "Look great" is going to be part of our grammar section for today.  So let's talk about that later. For now, let's talk about this phrase "living room."

**Lisa**: Okay, so your "living room" is the place for you(to) wath TV and hang out.

**Adam**: Yeah. You live there. My living room has a coffee table. Actually, my living room also has a shelf.

**Lisa**: Or if you have a family, maybe you've lots of toys in the living room.

**Adam**: Oh yeah, when I was young, my parents always said, "No toys in the living room."

**Lisa**: That's right. Because they want it to look nice for the guests.

**Adam**: Right.

> sofa `n.沙发`

**Lisa**: Now another thing that you often have in the living room is the sofa. So Eric says, "What about this sofa?"

**Adam**: Okay, I'm sure you guys know what a sofa is. You can sit on it, you can sleep on it.

**Lisa**: Yeah, it's great and usually you sit on the sofa when you watch movies. We also call it a couch`n.睡椅，长沙发；床；卧榻`

**Adam**: A couch. Yes, exactly. They are the same thing. Now, Eric says, "It feels so soft." "Feels" here is also going to be part of our grammar section. So we'll talk about that in a second.

**Lisa**: But it sounds like Jess agrees. She says, "It does." It does feel soft. "But it also looks like the old sofa at your grandma's house."

> prefer `v.更喜欢`

**Adam**: Oh, no. I like sofas. I don't know if I like old sofas. So Eric asks Jess, "Ok, so do you prefer something more modern?"

**Lisa**: "Do you prefer." This means like "do you like this more?"

**Adam**: I like this, but I really like that. So I could say, "I like this, but I prefer that."

**Lisa**: I do like some old houses. They're cute, but I prefer new houses.

**Adam**: Or people always ask me, "Adam, do you like tea?" I like tea, but I prefer coffee.

> modern `adj.现代的`

**Lisa**: Here Eric says, "Ok, so do you prefer something more modern?"

**Adam**: So remember the sofa at grandma's house is very old.

**Lisa**: Yes, yes, it is not modern. So something that is modern is new. "Modern" is a style.

**Adam**: So you can think about it as a new style. Maybe it's a modern building.

**Lisa**: Yeah, like it has a pool in it. It has a gym in it.

**Adam**: Oh, yeah, or maybe you wear really modern clothes.

**Lisa**: Or maybe you live in a modern city.

**Adam**: China has so many modern cities.

**Lisa**: But in Canada, it's not really modern.

**Adam**: Yeah, old cities.

**Lisa**: But does Jess prefer something more modern?

**Adam**: She says yes and then she asks, "What about this one over here?"

**Lisa**: And Eric says, "It's perfect! Let's get that."

**Adam**: Okay, and "get" here just means buy, right?

**Lisa**: That's right, now this is the end of our dialogue. So let's look at the grammar.

**Lisa**: In today's lesson. Jess and Eric said, "They'll look great in our living room," and "it feels so soft."

**Adam**: "Look" and "feel," these two verbs we can call them "sense verbs." We can look; we can feel; we can hear; we can smell, and we can taste.

**Lisa**: But we can use these words to give more information. We can add adjectives.

**Adam**: Most verbs, you can't really put an adjective after it.

**Lisa**: Yeah, like "it shops good"?

**Adam**: It shops good? He says comfortable?

**Lisa**: Yeah.

**Adam**: You can't really do that. Of course, we can with "is." He is happy. She is nice, but with other verbs, it's not good. But with these sense verbs: look, feel, taste, sound, we can always add an adjective.

**Lisa**: Like "you look beautiful."

**Adam**: Oh, thank you.

**Lisa**: Okay, but we always use this pattern: subject, sense verb and then the adjective.

**Adam**: Right, okay, so let's give some more examples. If your auntie`n.伯母；阿姨；姑妈；姨妈；舅妈` or your mother make some soup, you can say "Oh, the soup smells so good."

**Lisa**: Or if someone gives you a really good idea, for example, "let's go get some beer."

**Adam**: Oh, that sounds fun. That sounds great.

**Lisa**: Or maybe your coworker calls you and they say, "I...."

**Adam**: Oh, Jeez, Lisa. Are you okay? You sound sick.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so we can use "sound" that way too. When we say that two things are similar, we add "like" and say "feels like," "looks like," "smells like," "tastes like," and "sounds like."

**Adam**: That's right. Remeber that Jess says, "It also looks like the old sofa at your grandma's house."

**Lisa**:  Yeah, so the sofa in the store looks like the sofa at Eric's house.

**Adam**: I wonder if it smells like the sofa at grandma's house.

**Lisa**: It might`v.可以；或许（may 的过去式）；应该`. It might. Okay, but I often hear people say that I look like my dad. Yeah, and my brother looks like my mom.

**Adam**: Okay, I look like my dad. Okay, so that's gonna bring us to the end of the grammar section today. Make sure to check out some more examples on the app.

**Lisa**: Now, let's listen to the dialogue one more time.

**Adam**: Sounds good.

**Lisa**: Okay, we are back. So in today's lesson, we learned to talk about the furniture that we like and don't like.

**Adam**: We learned how to use a pattern "verb plus adjective" to descibe what something looks like, and also to talk about things that we don't like, like sofas that look like grandma's old sofa.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so when Jess said that, we know that she doesn't like it.

**Adam**: Uh-huh. And we also learn to use the word "prefer," which is a very, very good word to use when you are shopping for furniture. "Oh, this one's okay, but I prefer this one."

**Lisa**: Yeah, I prefer the bigger sofa.

**Adam**: I prefer the cheaper sofa.

**Lisa**: Yeah, I think a lot of people do. Okay, but what about you guys? Do you like shopping for furniture? What do you prefer?

**Adam**: That's right, guys. Please leave us a comment or question. We love to read them. Thanks for listening and we'll see you next time.

**Lisa**: Yep, see you then.
