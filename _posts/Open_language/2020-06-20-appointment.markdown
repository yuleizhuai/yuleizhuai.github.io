## 02.课程精讲

### 课程热身 

**Connor**: Hello and welcome to OpenLanguage. This is Connor.

**Lisa**: And this is Lisa.

**Connor**: Last week we had a lesson called "Making an appointment."

**Lisa**: Yes, but this time we are actually canceling an appointment.

**Connor**: So we have a dialogue between the receptionist`（n.接待员；传达员）` and Julie Baker. And Julie nees to cancel her appointment.

**Lisa**: Okay. Well, why don't we go ahead and listen to what Julie has to say?

**Connor**: Okay.



### 核心对话

**A**: Hello, Mr. Thompson's Office. How may I help you? `您好，这里是 Thompson 的办公室。我能帮您做些什么？`

**B**: Hi, there. It's Julie Baker. I'm calling about my appointment today. `你好。我是 Julie Baker。我是为了今天的预约打电话过来。`

**A**: Yes, you appointment at 1 pm. `是的，您的预约在下午 1 点。`

**B**: Yes, could we change it to Monday? I have an emergency. `是的，可以调整到星期一吗？我突然有急事。`

**A**: Oh, I see. I think that will be okay. `哦，明白了。没有问题。`

**B**: Thank you so much. Sorry for canceling. `非常感谢。突然取消，不好意思。`

**A**: No problem. I'll move the appointment to the same time Monday. `没关系。那我就把预约跳到星期一的相同时段。`

**B**: Sounds great. See you then. `听起来不错。到时候见。`



## 03.对话精讲

> appointment `n.预约`

**Connor**: Okay we just heard that conversation `(n.交谈，会话；社交)`, and she's calling to cancel an appointment.

**Lisa**: Yes, now first of all, the people at the office picks up the phone, and says, "Hello, Mr. Thompson's Office. How may I help you?"

> the same `phr.一样`

**Connor**: Yes, I think that's the same thing we heard in the last week's lesson, right?

**Lisa**: Yes, this is just how we answer the phone at work?

**Connor**: And Julie says, "Hi, there. It's Julie Baker." Now, this is really important, because she doesn't say "I'm Julie Baker" or "This is Julie Baker." She says, "It's Julie Baker."

**Lisa**: Yes. When we are calling someone that we already know, we use "it's."

**Connor**: This is really important. It's not the first time they're talking to Julie Baker, so "It's Julie Baker." And she introduces the reason why she's calling. She says, "I'm calling about my appointment today."

**Lisa**: Yes, and she uses the present continuous "I'm calling about...." And this is what we use when we're doing the action right now.

**Connor**: This is actually our grammar point, so we'll take a closer look at this grammar point a liitle bit later.

**Lisa**: Okay. Now, she is calling about her appointment, right?

**Connor**: Yes, an appointment is a plan to meet, or visit, or see someone at a place.

**Lisa**: Yeah, but this person is not usually your friend, right?

**Connor**: No, it's usually a doctor, or a dentist `(n.牙科医生)`, or like a work meeting.

**Lisa**: Yeah, like a coworker `(n.同事，合作者)`, or your boss. Last class, we made an appointment, and this time we're talking about canceling an appointment.

> change `v.改变`

**Connor**: Yes, and we'll talk a little bit about that word "canceling" later. You can also change an appointment.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so her appointment is at 1 pm but she needs to change it. She needs a different time.

**Connor**: Yes, and you're probably seen this word many times, "change." It just means to make it different.

**Lisa**: Yeah, for example, you cloud change your clothes. Maybe I'm wearing a T-shirt but I want to wear a long-sleeve shirt.

**Connor**: Because it's cold, right? Maybe it's cold. You can even change your job. If you don't like your job and you want to try a new job. Maybe, "I'll change my job."

**Lisa**: Yeah, and when you're making an appointment, you know what, sometimes you need to change the day or change the time.

> emergency `n.紧急事件`

**Connor**: Yes, you may need to change your appointent if you have an emergency.

**Lisa**: Well, an emergency is a really really big problem that you need to fix now.

**Connor**: Yeah, you have to fix it right now. So if I fall `(vi.摔倒)` and I break my arm, that's an emergency, right?

**Lisa**: Yeah, you have to go to the hospital.

**Connor**: I can't wait for it to get better. "Oh, my arm is broken. It's okay." "No, that's an emergency!"

**Lisa**: Yeah, or maybe you have a family emergency. Someone in your family is hurt.

**Connor**: Yes if you see the hospital car going...

**Lisa**: That is an emergency.

**Connor**: That's an emergency. Yeah. Did you like my sound?

**Lisa**: I did. Okay, but it seems that something big has happened to Julie, because she says, "I have an emergency." And what does the man at the office say?

**Connor**: Well, he says, "I see. I think that will be okay."

> canceling `v.取消`

**Lisa**: Yes, and she says, "Thank you so much. Sorry for canceling."

**Connor**: So, this is really important. This word "cancel." "Cancel" means to stop something.

**Lisa**: Yeah, so for example, if you have plans with your friends, but if you're busy, then you might have to cancel. "Sorry, I can't come."

**Connor**: "Oh! You canceled? Oh! I was hoping to meet you!"

**Lisa**: Yeah, I'm sorry.

**Connor**: Alright, you could also cancel a game. Like if it's raining, it's no fun to play soccer, so you might want to cancel your game.

**Lisa**: Yeah, or if you are traveling to another country, your airplane, your flight might be canceled.

**Connor**: Yes, and this is really important that we add "-ing." Anytime we want to say "I'm sorry," we say it like this: sorry for + verb-ing. So in this case, "sorry for canceling."

> move `v.调整`

**Lisa**: That's right. But the man says, "No problem. I'll move the appointment to the same time Monday."

**Connor**: So "move" is when you change your place, like if I am walking then that means I'm "moving."

**Lisa**: Yeah, or you can move to a different city, right?

**Connor**: Yes, that means you're moving your house. When I wake up in the morning, I'm so tired. I don't want to move.

**Lisa**: I know the feeling too. Okay, but you can move the time or you can move the place.

**Connor**: Yes, or even an appointment in this case.

**Lisa**: Yes, so he is moving the appointment to the same time Monday.

**Connor**: "Same" means "not different." So if I cancel today and meet on the same time tomorrow, that maybe means 1 pm tomorrow.

**Lisa**: Exactly. Or, for example, you're wearing a black shirt. I'm wearing a black shirt. We are wearing the same color.

**Connor**: Yes, we can even talk about days. For example, I pay my rent`(n.租金)` on the same day every month.

**Lisa**: Yeah, for example, one time I went to a party and another girl and I were wearing the same dress.

**Connor**: Now this is really important for this world. We always say "the same," "the" is always with "same."

**Lisa**: Yes, for example, we were in "the same" class.

**Connor**: "The same." And that sounds good to Julie. She has canceled her appointment. Everything's good. I think it's time to do our grammar point.

**Lisa**: Okay, so earlier Julie said, "I'm calling about my appointment today."

**Connor**: We use this to talk about what we are doing now. But when we make a phone call, or write an email, or send a text message, we use this to introduce the reason why. Why are we calling? Why are we writing?

**Lisa**: Yeah, for example, if you call a restaurant you might say, "I'm calling about my reservation`(n.预约，预定；保留)`."

**Connor**: Yes, in an email you cloud say, "I'm writing to tell you about my new job."

**Lisa**: Yeah, or in a text message I might say, "I am sending you this message to tell you that I can't come."

**Connor**: Okay, well, that will be our grammar point. Please check that out. Now let's take another listen to that dialogue.

**Lisa**: Alright, sounds good.

**Connor**: All right. So Julie Baker has canceled her appointment. Lisa, I wonder `(vi.怀疑；想知道；惊讶)` do you often cancel your appointments?

**Lisa**: Sometimes. Sometimes. I try not to, but sometimes you make the appointment a long time ago, right? And then something happens, so you just need to change the time or cancel it.

**Connor**: Like an emergency. Maybe you have a lot of emergencys?

**Lisa**: Sometimes. Sometimes. Not too many.

**Connor**: Yes, this happens. But we want to hear from you guys. Have you ever`adv.曾经` canceled an appointment? What did you say? Was it an emergency?

**Lisa**: Yeah. Did you move the appointment? What happened? And what did you say?

**Connor**: Let us know. Leave a comment or ask a question, and we'll look forward to reading those.
